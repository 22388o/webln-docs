# Introduction

WebLN outlines a spec that is implemented by a myriad of providers. This documentation covers both how to use WebLN in your Lightning-driven applications, but also how to implement a provider.

## For App Developers

Jump into the [Getting Started](/getting-started) section to see how to install and use WebLN in your app.

## For Provider Developers

Jump into the [WebLN Provider](/webln-provider) docs to see what a provider is, and the functions it should implement.

## A Note About TypeScript

Code samples in this documentation will be in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically-typed variant of JavaScript. WebLN is fully typed, and it's highly recommended you use TypeScript when using it for the best developer experience. Likewise, it's also recommended if you're implementing a provider, to make certain that you're compliant to the spec.
